<h5>Python Reflection</h5>
  <div class="me">
    <p>Similarities between :<br>
    You can define your own functions and make variables. You can also get user inputs that actually effect the code if you want to.<br>
    Differences:<br>
    In python there aren't blocks to help you put different pieces of code together. You have to know the syntax of the code in order to make anything work.

      This project was different because we were given way less instruction and we really had to figure out how to do it by ourselves. Being taught about lists and how to call upon different elements was really helpful. I worked with Carolina, who was in a different group, and it was really helpful because we each understood different concepts about the assignment, and we were able to combine what we know in order to make a successful filter. If it were possibe with my knowledge, I'd like to try making a filter similar to the snapchat one.

    <h5>Robots</h5>
    <p>
        <br>
        This project gave mee a good base knowledge of C in Arduino. In every Arduino sketch, you need a void setup and a void loop. Both Veloso and Ayanna Howard worked with robots and used them to help better our lives and gain a better understanding/use of AI and (computer) learning. My Team googled a lot to make the lightshow work, but we got sidetracked a lot and got into a discussion about dating older people. Other groups had very exact code, but with ours we just used many for loops, variables for different pins, and the random function to change the delay and the amount of flash repetition.
